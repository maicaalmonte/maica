cute n simple instruction :)

1. install pandas <3

    ``` bash
      pip install pandas

2. install openpxyl <3 for pdf conversion

   ``` bash
     pip install openpyxl

3. if you prefer to install two packages all at once <3
   ``` bash
     pip install pandas openpyxl

4. verify installation (to confirm if the packages are installed correctly) :)
   
   ```bash
    import pandas as pd
    import openpyxl

    print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
    print("OpenPyXL is installed.")
  
***notes: you can install as many python packages as you want, they won't interfere your script. even if you won't use them.
what matters is whether your script needs a package and is missing from your environment :)
